# Self Hosted Applications

This repository serves as both a backup (for me) and a reference (for anyone else) for how my self-hosted applications are configured.

I host them on the Google Cloud Platform in a docker-optimized instance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
1. Install docker and docker-compose.
1. Run: `docker network create nginx-proxy`
